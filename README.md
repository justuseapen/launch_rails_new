# Launch Rails Template

This is a template I built while in Launch Academy. I still use it and keep it updated with the latest stable releases of Ruby and Rails.

INSPIRED BY THE WORKS OF @dennybritz & @dpickett

## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m https://raw.github.com/justuseapen/launch_rails_new/master/template.rb
```

## What it does

1. Sets you up with a postgres database.yml (DON'T FORGET TO EDIT WITH YOUR PROJECT NAME!)

2. Sets you up with the postgres gem

3. Sets you up with kick-ass test suite that includes rspec, factorygirl, shoulda_matchers, capybara, pry-rails, better_errors, binding of caller, meta-request, launchy, and valid_attribute

4. Initializes a new git repository with an initial commit.

5. Optionally creates a github repository.

## TODO

Here are some things I'd like to add:

- Better documentation and comments
- Whatever you want! Make a pull request!
