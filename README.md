# Rails Startup template

This is a template I use for my new Ruby on Rails 4 applications as a student . **Pull requests are welcome.**

## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m https://raw.github.com/justuseapen/launch_rails_new/master/template.rb
```

## What it does

1. Sets you up with a postgres database.yml

2. Sets you up with the postgres gem

3. Sets you up with kick-ass test suite that includes rspec, factorygirl, shoulda_matchers, capybara, pry-rails, better_errors, binding of caller, meta-request, and valid_attribute

4. Initializes a new git repository with an initial commit.

5. Optionally creates a github repository.

## TODO

Here are some things I'd like to add:

- Better documentation and comments
- Whatever you want! Make a pull request!
